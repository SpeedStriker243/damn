# `damn`
For when you just can't stand your computer.

## damn: The story
Let's say you're finally home from work after a long day and all you want to do is take out your frustrations on your computer.

So you open up your terminal, and you type `damn it`...
The result?

```
Command 'damn' not found, did you mean:

  command 'dman' from deb debian-goodies (0.84)
  command 'dman' from deb bikeshed (1.78-0ubuntu1)
  command 'dan' from deb emboss (6.6.0+dfsg-7ubuntu2)

Try: sudo apt install <deb name>
```
```
'damn' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

How boring is that? This program aims to change that.<br>
